To import and run the mobile application using Android Studio, follow these steps:

1- Install Android Studio: Download and install the latest version of Android Studio from the official website (https://developer.android.com/studio).

Open Android Studio: Launch Android Studio once the installation is complete.

2- Import Project (ArrosageIntellegentV2): Click on "Open an Existing Project" or select "File" from the top menu, then choose "Open" or "Open Project." Browse to the location where your project is stored and select the project folder. Click "OK" to import the project.

3- Gradle Build: After importing the project, Android Studio will initiate a Gradle build process. This process downloads any necessary dependencies and sets up the project structure. Wait for the build to complete.

4- Connect a Device or Start an Emulator: Connect your Android device to the computer using a USB cable or start an emulator through the Android Virtual Device (AVD) Manager in Android Studio. Ensure that the device/emulator is detected by Android Studio.

5- Build and Run the Application: From the toolbar at the top, select the target device/emulator and click on the "Run" button (typically a green triangle). Android Studio will build the project, install the app on the device/emulator, and launch it.

6- Test and Debug: Once the app is running, you can interact with it on the connected device/emulator. Use the debugging tools provided by Android Studio to analyze the app's behavior, set breakpoints, and track variables.
